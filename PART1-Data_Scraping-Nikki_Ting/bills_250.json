SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Temporary Reciprocity to Ensure \nAccess to Treatment Act'' or the ``TREAT Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is necessary to regulate, on a temporary and \n        emergency basis, the provision of interstate commerce as it \n        pertains to treatment by medical professionals licensed in one \n        State to patients in other States.\n            (2) COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has created \n        a national public health emergency, as declared by the \n        Secretary of Health and Human Services under section 319 of the \n        Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d) on January 31, 2020, \n        and by the President under the National Emergencies Act on \n        March 13, 2020.\n            (3) The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in closing many \n        businesses and nonprofit organizations, including colleges and \n        universities, and large areas of the country remain under full \n        or partial stay-at-home orders, precluding the ability to seek \n        routine or elective medical treatment and consultation. The \n        closing of campus-based in-person learning at institutions of \n        higher education has also meant that up to 1,000,000 students \n        have returned to live with their families across State lines \n        from where they may have been receiving medical care in the \n        university setting. Furthermore, in many rural areas, in-person \n        medical treatment is inaccessible. Even in urban areas, the \n        pandemic has severely disrupted access to medical care, \n        requiring medical professionals licensed in one State to \n        provide treatment to patients residing nearby but across a \n        State line and unable to visit the medical professional's \n        office in the State of licensure.\n            (4) It is vital that hospitals, temporary surge or field \n        facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and nursing homes in \n        areas with high caseloads of COVID-19 patients be able to have \n        access to qualified medical professionals, including such \n        professionals licensed in other States, without the delays that \n        would be required for individualized licensing during a time \n        when State agencies' capacity to review and process licensing \n        requests are limited by the pandemic.\n            (5) The provision of services by medical professionals, \n        including services provided at no cost and services provided to \n        patients in a State other than the State or States in which the \n        medical professional maintains an office for professional \n        services, affects interstate commerce. When used to provide \n        services to patients located in a State other than the State in \n        which the medical professional is located, telehealth services, \n        as defined in section 3, utilize facilities of interstate \n        commerce.\n            (6) The inability of patients to visit in-State health care \n        providers during the current crisis substantially affects \n        interstate commerce. Economic activity has been limited by \n        public health authorities and other government officials to \n        ``flatten the curve'' of infections and hospitalizations and \n        thereby prevent the health care system from becoming \n        overwhelmed. Maximizing the efficient and effective use of \n        health care resources is therefore vital to reopening the \n        economy.\n            (7) Barriers to the efficient delivery of health care \n        services will lead to a shortage of those services that \n        substantially affect health care availability across State \n        lines. Shortages in health care services in one State prompt \n        interstate travel to obtain health care in other States, even \n        though discouraging such travel, particularly among the sick, \n        is vital to containing the contagion and reopening the national \n        economy.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) the term ``health care professional'' means an \n        individual who--\n                    (A) has a valid and unrestricted license or \n                certification from, or is otherwise authorized by, a \n                State, the District of Columbia, or a territory or \n                possession of the United States, for any health \n                profession, including mental health; and\n                    (B) is not affirmatively excluded from practice in \n                the licensing or certifying jurisdiction or in any \n                other jurisdiction;\n            (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health \n        and Human Services; and\n            (3) the term ``telehealth services'' means use of \n        telecommunications and information technology (including \n        synchronous or asynchronous audio-visual, audio-only, or store \n        and forward technology) to provide access to physical and \n        mental health assessment, diagnosis, treatment, intervention, \n        consultation, supervision, and information across distance.\n\nSEC. 4.

Such notice shall include the health care \nprofessional's--\n            (1) name;\n            (2) email address;\n            (3) phone number;\n            (4) State of primary license, certification, or \n        authorization; and\n            (5) license, certification, or authorization type, and \n        applicable number or identifying information with respect to \n        such license, certification, or authorization.\n    (e) Clarification.--Nothing in this section authorizes a health \ncare professional to--\n            (1) practice beyond the scope of practice authorized by--\n                    (A) any State, District of Columbia, territorial, \n                or local authority in the jurisdiction in which the \n                health care professional holds a license, \n                certification, or authorization described in section \n                3(1)(A); or\n                    (B) any State, District of Columbia, territorial, \n                or local authority in the jurisdiction in which the \n                patient receiving services is located;\n            (2) provide any service or subset of services prohibited by \n        any such authority in the jurisdiction in which the patient \n        receiving services is located;\n            (3) provide any service or subset of services in a manner \n        prohibited by any such authority the jurisdiction in which the \n        patient receiving services is located; or\n            (4) provide any service or subset of services in a manner \n        other than the manner prescribed by any such authority in the \n        jurisdiction in which the patient receiving services is \n        located.\n    (f) Investigative and Disciplinary Authority.--A health care \nprofessional providing services pursuant to the authority under this \nsection shall be subject to investigation and disciplinary action by \nthe licensing, certifying, or authorizing authorities in the \njurisdiction in which the patient receiving services is located. The \njurisdiction in which the patient receiving services is located shall \nhave the authority to preclude the health care provider from practicing \nfurther in its jurisdiction, whether such practice is authorized by the \nlaws of such jurisdiction or the authority granted under this section, \nand shall report any such preclusion to the licensing authority in the \njurisdiction in which the health care provider is licensed, certified, \nor authorized.\n    (g) Multiple Jurisdiction Licensure.--Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of this section, a health care professional shall be subject \nto the requirements of the jurisdiction of licensure if the \nprofessional is licensed in the State, the District of Columbia, or \nterritory or possession where the patient is located.\n    (h) Interstate Licensure Compacts.--If a health care professional \nis licensed in multiple jurisdictions through an interstate licensure \ncompact, with respect to services provided to a patient located in a \njurisdiction covered by such compact, the health care professional \nshall be subject to the requirements of the compact and not this \nsection.\n\nSEC. 5.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Public Housing Emergency Response \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Housing is a foundational determinant of health and has \n        been recognized as such since the early days of public health.\n            (2) Poor housing conditions contribute to a broad range of \n        infectious diseases, chronic diseases, injuries, childhood \n        development complications, nutrition issues, and mental health \n        challenges.\n            (3) The United States Housing Act of 1937 (Public Law 75-\n        412) charges the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n        (HUD) with providing residents with a decent, safe, and \n        affordable place to live, including those that live in public \n        housing.\n            (4) While public housing is a federally created program \n        overseen by HUD, the properties are owned and managed at the \n        local level by quasi-governmental public housing authorities \n        under contract with the Federal Government.\n            (5) Thus, the public housing program is governed in part by \n        Federal rules and regulations and in part by policies enacted \n        at the local level.\n            (6) Passage of the United States Housing Act of 1937 sought \n        to address the needs of low-income people through public \n        housing. At the time of passage of such Act, the Nation's \n        housing stock was of very poor quality. Public housing was a \n        significant improvement for those who had access to it.\n            (7) However, over the years the living conditions in public \n        housing began to deteriorate as the operational needs of the \n        units and costs necessary to remedy major capital deficiencies \n        began to outpace the level of funding provided by the Federal \n        Government and the residents' rent contributions.\n            (8) By 1990, no significant investment in housing \n        affordable to the lowest-income individuals had been made by \n        the Federal Government in more than 30 years.\n            (9) In 1998, the enactment of the Quality Housing and Work \n        Responsibility Act of 1998 (title V of Public Law 105-276) \n        prohibited public housing authorities from using any Federal \n        capital funding or operating funding to develop net new \n        housing.\n            (10) More than a decade after the enactment of the Quality \n        Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, the number of \n        public housing units nationally began to steadily decline, as \n        more units were torn down than rebuilt.\n            (11) With the exception of an infusion of funding from the \n        economic stimulus legislation in 2009--the American Recovery \n        and Reinvestment Act (Public Law 111-5)--Federal capital \n        funding has remained relatively level for more than a decade, \n        despite an increasing backlog in unmet capital needs.\n            (12) Today, there are approximately 1.2 million units of \n        public housing across the country receiving Federal funding. \n        The Nation's largest public housing authority, the New York \n        City Public Housing Authority, houses approximately 362,000 \n        residents in 302 developments across New York City.\n            (13) The Public Housing Capital Fund of the Department of \n        Housing and Urban Development remains the primary source of \n        funding public housing authorities rely on to address necessary \n        infrastructure upgrades and repairs.\n            (14) As of October 2019, the national public housing \n        capital repairs backlog was estimated to stand at more than $70 \n        billion.\n            (15) Federal disinvestment in public housing has forced \n        many residents to live in accelerating substandard living. For \n        example, the New York City Housing Authority has a capital \n        repair backlog currently estimated at more than $40 billion. \n        New York City Housing Authority residents suffer from a \n        consistent lack of hot water, insufficient heat during the \n        winter months, rodent and insect infestations, broken \n        elevators, and widespread and recurring lead and mold problems.\n            (16) Substandard housing conditions, such as poor \n        ventilation, pest infestations, and water leaks, are directly \n        associated with the development and exacerbation of respiratory \n        diseases like asthma.\n            (17) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n        made clear that no level of lead poisoning is safe. Lead \n        poisoning can result in irreversible brain damage and affects \n        every major bodily system. At high levels, lead poisoning can \n        cause anemia, multi-organ damage, seizures, coma, and death in \n        children. Even with the lowest levels of lead exposure, \n        children experience physical, cognitive, and neurobehavioral \n        impairment as well as lower IQ levels, lower class standing in \n        high school, greater absenteeism, lower vocabulary and \n        grammatical-reasoning scores, and poorer hand-eye coordination \n        relative to other children.\n            (18) Exposure to cold indoor temperatures is associated \n        with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n            (19) Due to its aging infrastructure, the living conditions \n        in public housing are causing severe health consequences for \n        public housing residents throughout the Nation, including \n        asthma, respiratory illness, and elevated blood lead levels.\n            (20) For example, one leading study found that children \n        living in public housing have higher odds of asthma than \n        children living in all types of private housing, even after \n        adjusting for individual risk factors such as minority \n        ethnicity and race, living in a low-income household, and \n        living in a low-income community.\n            (21) The rise of the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a new \n        level of risk into our society.\n            (22) Poor housing conditions have been linked with worse \n        health outcomes and infectious disease spread. One leading \n        study found that counties with a higher percentage of \n        households with poor housing had a higher incidence of, and \n        mortality associated with, COVID-19 and recommended targeted \n        health policies to support individuals living in poor housing \n        conditions in order to mitigate adverse outcomes associated \n        with COVID-19.\n            (23) This is a fixable public health crisis. Federal \n        disinvestment in public housing has consequences and aging \n        infrastructure is, in many cases, the root cause of many of \n        these health issues for residents.\n            (24) Therefore, it is necessary to reinvest in public \n        housing, provide the money needed to fulfill outstanding \n        capital needs, and to again ensure that all Americans have a \n        decent home and suitable living environment, as is HUD's \n        charge.\n\nSEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    There is authorized to be appropriated for assistance from the \nPublic Housing Capital Fund under section 9(d) of the United States \nHousing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) $70,000,000,000, which amount \nshall remain available until expended and, notwithstanding subsections \n(c)(1) and (d)(2) of such section 9, shall be allocated to public \nhousing agencies based upon the extent of such agencies' capital need, \nas determined according to the agencies' most recent Physical Needs \nAssessment.\n                                 <all>\n\n"

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum \nDisorder Consortium Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (in this section \n        and section 3 referred to as ``NMOSD'') is a devastating \n        neurologic disease leading to blindness, paralysis, and \n        premature death.\n            (2) There are an estimated 16,000 to 17,000 people with \n        NMOSD in the United States and more than a quarter-million \n        patients worldwide.\n            (3) Women are affected up to 7 times more than men, and \n        Afro-Caribbeans and Latino persons are about 2.5 times more \n        predisposed to NMOSD than Caucasians. The reasons why Blacks \n        and Hispanics are disproportionately affected cannot be fully \n        understood without further studies. Furthermore, why NMOSD \n        disproportionately occurs in females is unknown.\n            (4) The average age at diagnosis is approximately 35 to 45 \n        years, a peak window of time that further compounds the burden \n        of NMOSD on parenthood and careers of women and men. The age \n        range of NMOSD patients is broad and includes children as young \n        as 3 years of age and adults as old as 90.\n            (5) NMOSD imposes substantial costs for affected patients \n        and their families both in financial costs such those \n        associated with medical care, prescription medicines, and \n        emergency room visits, as well as in opportunity costs such as \n        its negative impact on maintaining gainful employment or \n        attending school or career development programs.\n            (6) The origins of NMOSD are unknown, but it is \n        hypothesized to be autoimmune in nature. Collectively, \n        autoimmune diseases currently affect approximately 1 in 10 \n        Americans. Without a clear understanding of the causes of \n        NMOSD, development of cures that save and improve lives and \n        reduce the substantial associated health care costs will not be \n        possible.\n            (7) Despite the recent Food and Drug Administration \n        approval of three medications for NMOSD, there remains an unmet \n        need for more effective and safe therapies to spare these \n        patients from this recurrent disease with its accumulating \n        neurologic disability.\n            (8) Because of their relatively low overall incidence, \n        orphan diseases like NMOSD frequently do not receive sufficient \n        attention and research funding. Of special importance is the \n        opportunity for the remarkable progress made recently regarding \n        NMOSD to serve as--\n                    (A) a model for solutions to rare and immunologic \n                diseases; and\n                    (B) an exemplary therapeutic disease target for \n                immunosuppressive therapies and for determining \n                vaccination benefits and risks relative to COVID-19.\n            (9) No single institution has a sufficient number of \n        patients to independently conduct research that will adequately \n        address the cause, prevention, treatment, and potential cure of \n        NMOSD. Furthermore, there is a paucity of resources available \n        for regenerative medicine research in NMOSD that will be \n        required to repair optic nerve and spinal cord damage caused by \n        NMOSD and thus to restore health.\n            (10) There has been no comprehensive study analyzing all \n        relevant clinical, biological, and epidemiological aspects of \n        NMOSD to identify potential risk factors and biomarkers for \n        NMOSD.\n            (11) We can apply our understanding of NMOSD to the study \n        of other autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes \n        mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, \n        systemic lupus erythematosus, and many others.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) there is a need to establish and coordinate a \n        synergistic, multicenter research effort based on collaboration \n        between regional consortia and governmental and nongovernmental \n        entities in order to--\n                    (A) comprehensively study the causes of NMOSD;\n                    (B) identify potential biomarkers of disease \n                activity;\n                    (C) leverage recent efforts in developing approved \n                therapies for NMOSD as a model for developing \n                breakthrough therapies for other autoimmune diseases; \n                and\n                    (D) highlight NMOSD as a model disease to better \n                understand the potential benefits and risks of \n                immunosuppressive therapy and innovative vaccine \n                strategies targeting COVID-19;\n            (2) there is a need to encourage a collaborative effort \n        among academic medical centers comprising epidemiological study \n        groups capable of gathering comprehensive and detailed \n        information for each patient enrolled in those groups; and\n            (3) the effort referred to in paragraph (2) should \n        facilitate investigation of environmental, nutritional, \n        genetic, and treatment factors with respect to the pathological \n        and epidemiological characteristics of NMOSD.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Anti-Racism in Public Health Act of \n2021''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) For centuries, structural racism, defined by the \n        National Museum of African American History and Culture as an \n        ``overarching system of racial bias across institutions and \n        society'', in the United States has negatively affected \n        communities of color, especially Black, Latinx, Asian American, \n        Pacific Islander, and American Indian and Alaska Native people, \n        to expand and reinforce White supremacy.\n            (2) Structural racism determines the conditions in which \n        people are born, grow, work, live, and age and determine \n        people's access to quality housing, education, food, \n        transportation, and political power, and other social \n        determinants of health.\n            (3) Structural racism serves as a major barrier to \n        achieving health equity and eliminating racial and ethnic \n        inequities in health outcomes that exist at alarming rates and \n        are determined by a wider set of forces and systems.\n            (4) Due to structural racism in the United States, people \n        of color are more likely to suffer from chronic health \n        conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, hepatitis, \n        and hypertension) and infectious diseases (such as HIV/AIDS, \n        and COVID-19) compared to their White counterparts.\n            (5) Due to structural racism in maternal health care in the \n        United States, Black and American Indian and Alaska Native \n        infants are more than twice as likely to die than White \n        infants, Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to die from \n        pregnancy-related causes than White women, and American Indian \n        and Alaska Native women are 5 times more likely to die from \n        pregnancy-related causes than White women. This trend persists \n        even when adjusting for income and education.\n            (6) Due to structural racism in the United States, Non-\n        Hispanic Black women have the highest rates for 22 of 25 severe \n        morbidity indicators used by the Center for Disease Control and \n        Prevention (CDC).\n            (7) Due to structural racism in the United States, people \n        of color comprise a disproportionate percentage of persons with \n        disabilities in the United States.\n            (8) Due to structural racism in the United States, Black \n        men are up to three and a half times as likely to be killed by \n        police as White men, and 1 in every 1,000 Black men will die as \n        a result of police violence. Policing has adverse effects on \n        mental health in Black communities.\n            (9) Due to the confluence of structural racism and factors \n        such as gender, class, and sexual orientation or gender \n        identity, commonly referred to as intersectionality, Black and \n        Latinx transgender women are more likely to die due to violence \n        and homicide than their White counterparts.\n            (10) Due to structural racism, inequitable access to \n        quality health care and long-term services and supports also \n        disproportionately burdens communities of color; people of \n        color and immigrants are less likely to be insured and are more \n        likely to live in medically underserved areas.\n            (11) Due to structural racism, older adults of color are \n        also more likely to be admitted to nursing homes and assisted \n        living facilities and to reside in those of poor quality, and \n        when older adults of color do receive home and community based \n        services, Medicaid spends less money on their services and they \n        are more likely to be hospitalized than older White adults.\n            (12) In addition, the Federal Government's failure to honor \n        the unique political status of American Indian and Alaska \n        Native people, to respect the inherent sovereignty of Tribal \n        Nations, and to uphold its trust and treaty obligations to \n        Tribal Nations and American Indian and Alaska Native people, is \n        an ongoing and unjust manifestation of centuries of oppression, \n        with the consequence of adverse health outcomes for Native \n        peoples.\n            (13) The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the devastating \n        impact of structural racism on the United States ability to \n        ensure equitable health outcomes for people of color, and made \n        these communities more likely to suffer from severe outcomes \n        due to the coronavirus infection.\n            (14) Racial and ethnic inequity in public health is a \n        result of systematic, personally mediated, and internalized \n        racism and racist public and private policies and practices, \n        and dismantling structural racism is integral to addressing \n        public health.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Antiracism.--The term ``antiracism'' is a collection of \n        antiracist policies that lead to racial equity, and are \n        substantiated by antiracist ideas.\n            (2) Antiracist.--The term ``antiracist'' is any measure \n        that produces or sustains racial equity between racial groups.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Anti-Racism in Public Health Act of \n2021''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) For centuries, structural racism, defined by the \n        National Museum of African American History and Culture as an \n        ``overarching system of racial bias across institutions and \n        society,'' in the United States has negatively affected \n        communities of color, especially Black, Latinx, Asian American, \n        Pacific Islander, and American Indian and Alaska Native people, \n        to expand and reinforce White supremacy.\n            (2) Structural racism determines the conditions in which \n        people are born, grow, work, live, and age and determine \n        people's access to quality housing, education, food, \n        transportation, and political power, and other social \n        determinants of health.\n            (3) Structural racism serves as a major barrier to \n        achieving health equity and eliminating racial and ethnic \n        inequities in health outcomes that exist at alarming rates and \n        are determined by a wider set of forces and systems.\n            (4) Due to structural racism in the United States, people \n        of color are more likely to suffer from chronic health \n        conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, hepatitis, \n        and hypertension) and infectious diseases (such as HIV/AIDS, \n        and COVID-19) compared to their White counterparts.\n            (5) Due to structural racism in maternal health care in the \n        United States, Black and American Indian and Alaska Native \n        infants are more than twice as likely to die than White \n        infants, Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to die from \n        pregnancy-related causes than White women, and American Indian \n        and Alaska Native women are 5 times more likely to die from \n        pregnancy-related causes than White women. This trend persists \n        even when adjusting for income and education.\n            (6) Due to structural racism in the United States, Non-\n        Hispanic Black women have the highest rates for 22 of 25 severe \n        morbidity indicators used by the Center for Disease Control and \n        Prevention (CDC).\n            (7) Due to structural racism in the United States, people \n        of color comprise a disproportionate percentage of persons with \n        disabilities in the United States.\n            (8) Due to structural racism in the United States, Black \n        men are up to three and a half times as likely to be killed by \n        police as White men, and 1 in every 1,000 Black men will die as \n        a result of police violence. Policing has adverse effects on \n        mental health in Black communities.\n            (9) Due to the confluence of structural racism and factors \n        such as gender, class, and sexual orientation or gender \n        identity, commonly referred to as intersectionality, Black and \n        Latinx transgender women are more likely to die due to violence \n        and homicide than their White counterparts.\n            (10) Due to structural racism, inequitable access to \n        quality health care and longterm services and supports also \n        disproportionately burdens communities of color; people of \n        color and immigrants are less likely to be insured and are more \n        likely to live in medically underserved areas.\n            (11) Due to structural racism, older adults of color are \n        also more likely to be admitted to nursing homes and assisted \n        living facilities and to reside in those of poor quality, and \n        when older adults of color do receive home and community based \n        services, Medicaid spends less money on their services and they \n        are more likely to be hospitalized than older White adults.\n            (12) In addition, the Federal Government's failure to honor \n        the unique political status of American Indian and Alaska \n        Native people, to respect the inherent sovereignty of Tribal \n        Nations, and to uphold its trust and treaty obligations to \n        Tribal Nations and American Indian and Alaska Native people, is \n        an ongoing and unjust manifestation of centuries of oppression, \n        with the consequence of adverse health outcomes for Native \n        peoples.\n            (13) The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the devastating \n        impact of structural racism on the United States ability to \n        ensure equitable health outcomes for people of color, and made \n        these communities more likely to suffer from severe outcomes \n        due to the coronavirus infection.\n            (14) Racial and ethnic inequity in public health is a \n        result of systematic, personally mediated, and internalized \n        racism and racist public and private policies and practices, \n        and dismantling structural racism is integral to addressing \n        public health.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Antiracism.--The term ``antiracism'' is a collection of \n        antiracist policies that lead to racial equity, and are \n        substantiated by antiracist ideas.\n            (2) Antiracist.--The term ``antiracist'' is any measure \n        that produces or sustains racial equity between racial groups.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Press Freedom Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Freedom of the press is a fundamental civil, political, \n        and human right that is foundational in the United States \n        democratic system and enshrined in the First Amendment of the \n        United States Constitution, which states (in part) ``Congress \n        shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech or of \n        the press . . .''.\n            (2) Freedom of the press is essential to a free, open, and \n        democratic system.\n            (3) Historically, United States foreign policy has advanced \n        freedom of the press as a central tenet, at home and abroad.\n            (4) The United States led the drafting of the Universal \n        Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in Paris on December 10, \n        1948, which enshrines the commitment of countries around the \n        world to protect and promote universal human rights and values \n        that are indispensable for human dignity, including freedom of \n        expression and of the press.\n            (5) Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n        states, ``Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and \n        expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions \n        without interference and to seek, receive and impart \n        information and ideas through any media and regardless of \n        frontiers.''.\n            (6) In 1823, Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``the only security of \n        all is in a free press''.\n            (7) A free and independent press has long been recognized \n        as an important aspect of the United States national security \n        and actions taken by foreign governments or organizations that \n        weaken free press protections are a national security threat to \n        the United States.\n            (8) The right to freedom of the press is under renewed and, \n        in some cases, increasing assault around the world, with \n        rhetoric delegitimizing and discrediting the media or \n        journalists, online harassment, physical attacks, legal \n        campaigns, censorship, and surveillance, all of which threaten \n        the ability of journalists to do their jobs safely and freely.\n            (9) In the past decade, the world has seen a significant \n        deterioration of press freedoms.\n            (10) According to Freedom House's ``Freedom in the Media \n        2019'' study--\n                    (A) 19 percent of the countries it designates as \n                ``Free'' with respect to press and journalistic freedom \n                have seen reductions in their press freedom score \n                during the past 5 years; and\n                    (B) 28 percent of the countries it designates as \n                ``Not Free'' have experienced further declines in press \n                freedom during the past 5 years.\n            (11) According to Reporters Without Border's 2020 World \n        Press Freedom Index--\n                    (A) approximately 74 percent of the countries of \n                the world are classified as ``problematic situation'' \n                or worse with respect to journalistic freedom;\n                    (B) approximately 26 percent of the countries of \n                the world have ``satisfactory'' or ``good'' press \n                freedom environments;\n                    (C) among the countries that have recently suffered \n                the largest declines in press freedom are Poland, \n                Turkey, Burundi, Hungary, Bolivia, and Serbia;\n                    (D) around the world, 2019 marked the fourth \n                consecutive year in which 300 or more journalists were \n                jailed;\n                    (E) the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated state \n                censorship, harassment, and violence in both \n                authoritarian and democratic states; and\n                    (F) authorities have detained journalists for \n                reporting on the pandemic in many nations, including \n                China, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Mali, Belarus, Azerbaijan, \n                Iran, the Philippines, Tajikistan, Poland, the \n                Democratic Republic of Congo, and Serbia.\n            (12) According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, in \n        2020--\n                    (A) at least 250 journalists worldwide were in \n                prison for the fifth consecutive year, with China, \n                Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia responsible for nearly \n                \\1/2\\ of the jailed journalists;\n                    (B) of the journalists detained--\n                            (i) 19 percent were detained without \n                        charge;\n                            (ii) 67 percent were imprisoned on anti-\n                        state charges; and\n                            (iii) nearly all were local journalists \n                        covering events in their own country;\n                    (C) at least 32 journalists were killed in the line \n                of duty, 22 of whom were targeted for murder, which \n                represents a sharp increase from 2019; and\n                    (D) there was complete impunity in an estimated 86 \n                percent of the cases of murdered journalists in the \n                last decade.\n            (13) Congress has recognized the importance of freedom of \n        the press by enacting--\n                    (A) the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act of \n                2009 (Public Law 111-166);\n                    (B) the Global Magnitsky Human Rights \n                Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public \n                Law 114-328); and\n                    (C) S. Res. 501, 115th Congress (recognizing \n                threats to freedom of the press and expression around \n                the world and reaffirming freedom of the press as a \n                priority in efforts of the Government of the United \n                States to promote democracy and good governance).\n            (14) The importance of freedom of the press has been \n        recognized by numerous United States presidential \n        administrations that span ideological and party lines, \n        including--\n                    (A) a 1786 letter to James Currie, in which \n                Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson wrote ``our liberty \n                depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be \n                limited without being lost.'';\n                    (B) an address to Congress on February 6, 1986, in \n                which President Ronald Reagan stated, ``Victories \n                against poverty are greatest and peace most secure \n                where people live by laws that ensure free press, free \n                speech, and freedom to worship, vote, and create \n                wealth'';\n                    (C) a statement by Secretary of State Condoleezza \n                Rice on April 11, 2007, stating that ``there is no more \n                important pillar of democracy than a free and active \n                press'';\n                    (D) a statement by former Secretary of State \n                Madeline Albright on May 31, 2018, reporting that \n                ``Freedom of the press is a basic aspect of democracy, \n                invented by Americans.''; and\n                    (E) a statement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \n                on May 3, 2019, stating, ``A free and independent media \n                is indispensable to a vibrant, functioning democracy. \n                Despite some progress, journalists around the world \n                continue to be persecuted, targeted with violence, or \n                even killed--all too often with impunity.''.\n            (15) Protection of a free and open press is not a partisan \n        issue.\n            (16) It is imperative that Congress further enshrine the \n        Department of State's role in protecting this basic human right \n        abroad.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to condemn violations of, and attacks on, press \n        freedoms;\n            (2) to promote, and to assist other governments in the \n        promotion of, the importance of a free and open press;\n            (3) to support press freedom abroad in all aspects of \n        American foreign policy; and\n            (4) to work with foreign governments that affirm and \n        protect press freedom--\n                    (A) to develop multilateral initiatives to combat \n                suppression of the free and independent press; and\n                    (B) to hold accountable those governments that \n                violate and attack press freedoms.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Transformational Reforms and Updates \nto Ensure Educational Quality and Urgent Investments in Today's Youth \nAct of 2021'' or the ``TRUE EQUITY Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The fate of our Nation and the opportunities it creates \n        for our children and grandchildren to enjoy successful careers \n        and rewarding lives depends on the quality, equal access, and \n        effectiveness of pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade \n        education in every local school district across the country.\n            (2) Our education systems must prepare students to compete \n        in an interconnected, global economy.\n            (3) Despite the current combinations of Federal, State, and \n        local funding and innovative educational policies, States with \n        historically well regarded kindergarten through grade 12 \n        education systems may find their students falling behind their \n        peers nationally and internationally. In Maryland, a State with \n        a historically well regarded kindergarten through grade 12 \n        education system, fourth and eighth graders placed in the \n        middle of the pack nationally in reading and math scores on the \n        National Assessment of Education Progress.\n            (4) The United States as a whole scored well down the \n        second quartile among students from 72 countries on the \n        Programme for International Student Assessment.\n            (5) Even in States with reading and math scores higher than \n        the national average, there may be significant and persistent \n        racial, ethnic, and income disparity gaps between students of \n        color and low-income students compared to their higher income \n        and white peers.\n            (6) These same disparities carry into college enrollment, \n        with fewer students of color and low-income students enrolling \n        in college than their higher income and white peers.\n            (7) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) health pandemic forced \n        the physical closure of schools nationwide in March 2020, \n        moving students from the classroom to online learning. The \n        public health necessity to turn to online learning further \n        exacerbated the significant and persistent racial, ethnic, and \n        income disparity learning gaps as students struggled to access \n        educational technology devices and the internet.\n            (8) At the start of online learning, Maryland school \n        districts reported that on average, nearly 25 percent of \n        Maryland students had not logged into their new online \n        classrooms or picked up paper work packets, falling out of \n        sight and behind their peers.\n            (9) Millions of children are falling further behind as a \n        result of opportunity gaps that fail to provide students with \n        ready access to individualized instruction, healthy meals, \n        mental health counseling services, and hands on career training \n        programs.\n            (10) In order to address these inequities in education and \n        harm caused by COVID-19, certain States, including Maryland, \n        have researched and proposed bold, transformative Federal, \n        State, and local funding and policy changes to their pre-\n        kindergarten through twelfth grade education systems, with five \n        main policy recommendations under the Maryland Commission on \n        Innovation & Excellence in Education that include the \n        following:\n                    (A) Investing in high-quality early childhood \n                education and care through a significant expansion of \n                full day pre-school, to be free for all low-income \n                three- and four-year-olds, so that all children have \n                the opportunity to begin kindergarten ready to learn.\n                    (B) Investing in teachers and school leaders by \n                elevating the standards and status of the teaching \n                profession, including a performance-based career ladder \n                and salaries comparable to other fields with similar \n                education requirements.\n                    (C) Creating a world-class instructional system \n                with an internationally benchmarked curriculum that \n                enables most students to achieve ``college and career \n                ready'' status by 10th grade and then pursue pathways \n                that include early college, Advanced Placement courses, \n                or a rigorous technical education leading to industry-\n                recognized credentials and high paying jobs.\n                    (D) Providing supports to students that need it the \n                most with broad and sustained support for schools \n                serving high concentrations of poverty, with after \n                school and summer academic programs and student access \n                to needed health and social services.\n                    (E) Ensuring excellence for all through an \n                accountability-oversight board that has the authority \n                to ensure transformative education system \n                recommendations are successfully implemented and \n                produce the desired improvements in student \n                achievement.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) no matter a child's zip code, they deserve equal access \n        to a quality, public pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade \n        education;\n            (2) no inequities in student achievement, college \n        enrollment, or Federal, State, and local funding should be \n        tolerated;\n            (3) the Federal Government should live up to its original \n        commitment in 1975 under the Individuals with Disabilities \n        Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) to provide 40 percent of \n        the cost to educate children with disabilities and assist State \n        educational agencies and local educational agencies in \n        providing a free appropriate public education; and\n            (4) the Federal Government should be an active partner with \n        State educational agencies and local educational agencies that \n        are willing to modify policies and commit additional State and \n        local resources to address education inequities.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Vote at Home Act of 2021''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An inequity of voting rights exists in the United \n        States because voters in some States have the universal right \n        to vote by mail while voters in other States do not.\n            (2) Many voters often have work, family, or other \n        commitments that make getting to polls and waiting in line on \n        the date of an election difficult or impossible. Many citizens \n        with disabilities are physically unable to vote due to long \n        lines, inadequate parking, no curb cuts, steep ramps, and large \n        crowds. In 2012, 30 percent of voters with disabilities had \n        difficulty voting, and in 2016, nearly two-thirds of the 137 \n        polling places inspected on election day had at least one \n        impediment to people with disabilities. Under current State \n        laws, many of these voters are not permitted to vote by mail.\n            (3) In 2020, despite a global pandemic, the general \n        election saw record high turnout as a result of increased vote \n        by mail options, which allowed voters to cast a ballot and stay \n        safe at the same time.\n            (4) Thirty-four States and the District of Columbia allow \n        universal absentee voting (also known as ``no-excuse'' absentee \n        voting), which permits any voter to request a mail-in ballot \n        without providing a reason for the request. No State which has \n        implemented no-excuse absentee voting has repealed it.\n            (5) Five States currently hold elections entirely by mail. \n        At least 22 States currently allow some elections to be \n        conducted by mail, especially in large and rural jurisdictions \n        where voting by mail is especially convenient. Polling stations \n        in rural jurisdictions tend to have higher costs per voter, \n        smaller staffs, and limited resources. Transportation is often \n        a crucial barrier for rural voters.\n            (6) In 2020, in order to provide greater accessibility and \n        to protect the public health, 30 States adopted or changed \n        their laws for the general election to allow voters to cast \n        their ballots from home. These changes included removing strict \n        excuse requirements, allowing COVID-19 concerns to be a valid \n        excuse to vote absentee, allowing ballot drop boxes, offering \n        prepaid postage on election mail, and proactively sending all \n        active registered voters applications to request an absentee \n        ballot--with some States even skipping that step and sending \n        the actual ballots.\n            (7) Voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their \n        choices, which is especially important as many ballots contain \n        greater numbers of questions about complex issues than in the \n        past due to the expanded use of the initiative and referendum \n        process in many States.\n            (8) Voting by mail is cost effective. After the State of \n        Oregon adopted vote by mail for all voters in 1996, the cost to \n        administer an election in the State dropped by nearly 30 \n        percent over the next few elections, from $3.07 per voter to \n        $2.21 per voter. After Colorado implemented all-mail balloting \n        in 2013, voting administration costs decreased by an average of \n        40 percent. The cost of conducting vote-by-mail elections is \n        generally one-third to one-half less than conducting polling \n        place elections. Voting by mail also saves a substantial amount \n        by getting rid of the temporary labor costs of hiring poll \n        workers. In addition to that cost, many jurisdictions have been \n        facing difficulty in obtaining sufficient numbers of poll \n        workers.\n            (9) Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can \n        reduce waiting times for those voters who choose to vote at the \n        polls. In 2016, voters in Arizona reported waiting in line from \n        1 to 5 hours to vote; in New York, voters reported that \n        stations ran out of ballots and did not have staff during all \n        of the hours scheduled for voting.\n            (10) Voting by mail is preferable to many voters as an \n        alternative to going to the polls. In 2018, 25.3 percent of \n        ballots in the United States were cast by mail, up from 10 \n        percent in 2000. In 2016, nearly 58 percent of California \n        voters chose to vote by mail. Voting by mail has become \n        increasingly popular with voters who want to be certain that \n        they are able to vote no matter what comes up on election day, \n        as it reduces the physical obstacles and eases the time \n        constraints connected with the act of voting.\n            (11) Despite attempts to claim that voting by mail is \n        susceptible to fraud, it is not. Strategies such as tracking \n        systems for ballots and postal service cooperation in \n        preventing ballots from being delivered to names not recognized \n        as receiving mail at an address nearly eliminate the potential \n        for fraud in vote by mail elections. Evidence of undue \n        influence or voter coercion after vote-by-mail implementation \n        in Oregon has been nonexistent to minimal.\n            (12) Many of the reasons which voters in many States are \n        required to provide in order to vote by mail require the \n        revelation of personal information about health, travel plans, \n        or religious activities, which violate voters' privacy while \n        doing nothing to prevent voter fraud.\n            (13) State laws which require voters to obtain a notary \n        signature to vote by mail only add cost and inconvenience to \n        voters without increasing security.\n            (14) Many voters choose to cast ballots early when they \n        have the option (over 50 percent in Arizona, Arkansas, \n        California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Montana, \n        Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, \n        Utah, and Washington). More than 40 percent of voters in the \n        2016 election cast their ballot before election day. In Oregon, \n        7 years after vote-by-mail election implementation, over 80 \n        percent of voters favored the vote-by-mail system.\n            (15) Vote-by-mail typically increases turnout in all \n        elections, but can be particularly effective in increasing \n        voter participation in special elections and primary elections. \n        Oregon, Washington, and Colorado, 3 of the 5 States with \n        entirely vote by mail elections, continue to have consistently \n        high voter turnout rates. In the 2016 Presidential election, \n        while the percentage of registered voters who cast a ballot \n        nationally was 68.1 percent, Oregon's was 80.3 percent, \n        Washington's was 78.76 percent, and Colorado's was 74.3 \n        percent.\n            (16) A crucial component of a modern voting system is \n        making it easy, affordable, and accessible to register to vote. \n        Twenty states and the District of Columbia have enacted \n        automatic voter registration policies, with Oregon and \n        California becoming the first to automatically register their \n        citizens to vote when they apply for a driver's license. \n        Automatic, permanent voter registration has the potential to \n        increase participation, protect election integrity, and reduce \n        registration costs.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Vote at Home Act of 2021''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) An inequity of voting rights exists in the United \n        States because voters in some States have the universal right \n        to vote by mail while voters in other States do not.\n            (2) Many voters often have work, family, or other \n        commitments that make getting to polls and waiting in line on \n        the date of an election difficult or impossible. Many citizens \n        with disabilities are physically unable to vote due to long \n        lines, inadequate parking, no curb cuts, steep ramps, and large \n        crowds. In 2012, 30 percent of voters with disabilities had \n        difficulty voting, and in 2016, nearly two-thirds of the 137 \n        polling places inspected on Election Day had at least one \n        impediment to people with disabilities. Under current State \n        laws, many of these voters are not permitted to vote by mail.\n            (3) In 2020, despite a global pandemic, the general \n        election saw record high turnout as a result of increased vote \n        by mail options, which allowed voters to cast a ballot and stay \n        safe at the same time.\n            (4) 34 States and the District of Columbia currently allow \n        universal absentee voting (also known as ``no-excuse'' absentee \n        voting), which permits any voter to request a mail-in ballot \n        without providing a reason for the request. No State which has \n        implemented no-excuse absentee voting has repealed it.\n            (5) 5 States currently hold elections entirely by mail. At \n        least 22 States currently allow some elections to be conducted \n        by mail, especially in large and rural jurisdictions where \n        voting by mail is especially convenient. Polling stations in \n        rural jurisdictions tend to have higher costs per voter, \n        smaller staffs, and limited resources. Transportation is often \n        a crucial barrier for rural voters.\n            (6) In 2020, in order to provide greater accessibility and \n        to protect the public health, 30 States adopted or changed \n        their laws for the general election to allow voters to cast \n        their ballots from home. These changes included removing strict \n        excuse requirements or allowing COVID-19 concerns to be a valid \n        excuse to vote absentee, allowing ballot drop boxes, offering \n        prepaid postage on election mail and proactively sending all \n        active registered voters applications to request an absentee \n        ballot, with some even skipping that step and sending the \n        actual ballots.\n            (7) Voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their \n        choices, which is especially important as many ballots contain \n        greater numbers of questions about complex issues than in the \n        past due to the expanded use of the initiative and referendum \n        process in many States.\n            (8) Voting by mail is cost effective. After the State of \n        Oregon adopted vote by mail for all voters in 1996, the cost to \n        administer an election in the State dropped by nearly 30 \n        percent over the next few elections, from $3.07 per voter to \n        $2.21 per voter. After Colorado implemented all-mail balloting \n        in 2013, voting administration costs decreased by an average of \n        40 percent. The cost of conducting vote-by-mail elections is \n        generally one-third to one-half less than conducting polling \n        place elections. Voting by mail also saves a substantial amount \n        by getting rid of the temporary labor costs of hiring poll \n        workers. In addition to that cost, many jurisdictions have been \n        facing difficulty in obtaining sufficient numbers of poll \n        workers.\n            (9) Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can \n        reduce waiting times for those voters who choose to vote at the \n        polls. In 2016, voters in Arizona reported waiting in line from \n        1 to 5 hours to vote; in New York, voters reported that \n        stations ran out of ballots and did not have staff during all \n        of the hours scheduled for voting.\n            (10) Voting by mail is preferable to many voters as an \n        alternative to going to the polls. In 2018, 25.3 percent of \n        ballots in the United States were cast by mail, up from 10 \n        percent in 2000. Voting by mail has become increasingly popular \n        with voters who want to be certain that they are able to vote \n        no matter what comes up on Election Day, as it reduces the \n        physical obstacles and eases the time constraints connected \n        with the act of voting.\n            (11) Despite attempts to claim that voting by mail is \n        susceptible to fraud, it is not. Strategies such as the \n        tracking systems for ballots and Postal Service cooperation in \n        preventing ballots from being delivered to names not recognized \n        as receiving mail at an address nearly eliminate the potential \n        for fraud in vote by mail elections. Evidence of undue \n        influence or voter coercion after vote-by-mail implementation \n        in Oregon has been nonexistent to minimal.\n            (12) Many of the reasons which voters in many States are \n        required to provide in order to vote by mail require the \n        revelation of personal information about health, travel plans, \n        or religious activities, which violate voters' privacy while \n        doing nothing to prevent voter fraud.\n            (13) State laws which require voters to obtain a notary \n        signature to vote by mail only add cost and inconvenience to \n        voters without increasing security.\n            (14) Many voters choose to cast ballots early when they \n        have the option (over 50 percent in Arizona, Arkansas, \n        California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Montana, \n        Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, \n        Utah, and Washington). More than 40 percent of voters in the \n        2016 election cast their ballot before Election Day. In Oregon, \n        7 years after vote-by-mail election implementation, over 80 \n        percent of voters favored the vote-by-mail system.\n            (15) Vote-by-mail typically increases turnout in all \n        elections, but can be particularly effective in increasing \n        voter participation in special elections and primary elections. \n        Oregon, Washington, and Colorado, 3 of the 5 States with \n        entirely vote by mail systems, continue to have consistently \n        high voter turnout rates. In the 2016 Presidential election, \n        while the percentage of registered voters who cast a ballot \n        nationally was 68.1 percent, Oregon's was 80.3 percent, \n        Washington's was 78.76 percent, and Colorado's was 74.3 \n        percent.\n            (16) A crucial component of a modern voting system is \n        making it easy, affordable, and accessible to register to vote. \n        Twenty states and the District of Columbia have enacted \n        automatic voter registration policies, with Oregon and \n        California becoming the first to automatically register their \n        citizens to vote when they apply for a driver's license. \n        Automatic, permanent voter registration has the potential to \n        increase participation, protect election integrity, and reduce \n        registration costs.\n\nSEC. 3.

WILDLIFE MARKET DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``wildlife market''--\n            (1) means a commercial market that--\n                    (A) sells or slaughters terrestrial, including \n                avian, wildlife for human consumption as food or \n                medicine, whether the animals originated in the wild or \n                in a captive environment; and\n                    (B) delivers a product in communities where \n                alternative nutritional or protein sources are \n                available; and\n            (2) does not include markets in areas where no other \n        practical alternative sources of protein or meat exists, such \n        as wildlife markets in rural areas on which indigenous people \n        rely to feed themselves and their families.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY ON RISK OF WILDLIFE MARKETS ON THE EMERGENCE OF NOVEL \n              VIRAL PATHOGENS.\n\n    Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services shall seek to enter into an \nagreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and \nMedicine under which the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, \nand Medicine agrees to--\n            (1) conduct a study to evaluate--\n                    (A) the impact of physical proximity and \n                consumption of terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine \n                on the emergence of viral and other microbial \n                pathogens;\n                    (B) the impact of consumption of terrestrial \n                wildlife as food or medicine on the transmission of \n                novel viral and other microbial pathogens;\n                    (C) the role consumption of terrestrial wildlife as \n                food or medicine has on the transmission of microbes \n                from animals to humans; and\n                    (D) the conditions at live wildlife markets that \n                lead to transmission of zoonotic diseases; and\n            (2) not later than one year after the date of such \n        agreement, submit a report to the Committee on Health, \n        Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee \n        on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives on the \n        findings of the study described in paragraph (1).\n\nSEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that global \ninstitutions, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), \nand the World Health Organization (WHO), together with leading \nnongovernmental organizations, veterinary colleges, and the United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID), should promote the \nparadigm of One Health--the integration of human health, animal health, \nagriculture, ecosystems, and the environment as an effective and \nintegrated way to address the complexity of emerging disease threats.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \nfacilitate international cooperation by working with international \npartners and through intergovernmental, international, and \nnongovernmental organizations such as the United Nations to--\n            (1) lead a resolution at the United Nations Security \n        Council or General Assembly and World Health Assembly outlining \n        the danger to human and animal health from emerging zoonotic \n        infectious diseases, with recommendations for implementing the \n        worldwide closure of wildlife markets and the ending of the \n        associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed \n        and supply those markets, except for in such countries or \n        regions where the consumption of wildlife is necessary for \n        local food security or where such actions would significantly \n        disrupt a readily available and irreplaceable food supply;\n            (2) work with governments through existing treaties and the \n        United Nations to develop a new protocol or agreement, and \n        amend existing protocols or agreements, regarding stopping \n        deforestation and other ecosystem destruction, closing \n        commercial wildlife markets for human consumption, and end the \n        associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed \n        and supply those markets while ensuring full consideration to \n        the needs and rights of indigenous peoples and local \n        communities that are dependent on wildlife for their food \n        security, national sovereignty, and local laws and customs;\n            (3) disrupt and ultimately end the commercial international \n        trade in terrestrial wildlife associated with wildlife markets \n        and eliminate commercial wildlife markets;\n            (4) disrupt and ultimately eliminate wildlife trafficking \n        associated with the operation of wildlife markets;\n            (5) raise awareness on the dangerous potential of wildlife \n        markets as a source of zoonotic diseases such as the novel \n        coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 and reduce demand \n        for the consumption of wildlife through evidence-based behavior \n        change programs while ensuring that existing wildlife habitat \n        is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of this process;\n            (6) encourage and support alternate forms of food \n        production, farming, and shifts to domestic animal- or plant-\n        source foods instead of terrestrial wildlife where able and \n        appropriate, and reduce consumer demand for terrestrial \n        wildlife through enhanced local and national food systems, \n        especially in areas where wildlife markets play a significant \n        role in meeting subsistence needs while ensuring that existing \n        wildlife habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of \n        this process; and\n            (7) strive to increase hygienic standards implemented in \n        markets around the globe, especially those specializing in the \n        sale of products intended for human consumption.\n    (c) Activities.--\n            (1) Global prohibitions and enforcement.--The United States \n        Government, working through the United Nations and its \n        components, as well as international organization such as \n        Interpol and the World Organisation for Animal Health, and in \n        furtherance of the policies described in subsection (b), \n        shall--\n                    (A) collaboratively with other member states, issue \n                declarations, statements, and communiques urging a \n                global ban on commercial wildlife markets and trade for \n                human consumption; and\n                    (B) urge increased enforcement of existing laws to \n                end wildlife trafficking.\n            (2) International coalitions.--The Secretary of State shall \n        seek to build international coalitions focused on ending \n        commercial wildlife markets for human consumption and \n        associated wildlife trade which feeds and supplies said \n        markets, with a focus on the following efforts:\n                    (A) Providing assistance and advice to other \n                governments in the adoption of legislation and \n                regulations to close wildlife markets and trade for \n                human consumption.\n                    (B) Creating economic pressure on wildlife markets \n                and their supply chains to prevent their operation.\n                    (C) Providing assistance and guidance to other \n                governments to prohibit the import, export, and \n                domestic trade of live terrestrial wildlife for the \n                purpose of human consumption.\n                    (D) Engaging and receiving guidance from key \n                stakeholders at the ministerial, local government, and \n                civil society level in countries that will be impacted \n                by this Act and where wildlife markets and associated \n                wildlife trafficking is the predominant source of meat \n                or protein, in order to mitigate the impact of any \n                international efforts on local customs, conservation \n                methods, or cultural norms.\n            (3) Authorization of imposition of sanctions.--\n                    (A) Finding and report required.--\n                            (i) In general.--The Secretary of

WILDLIFE MARKET DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``wildlife market''--\n            (1) means a commercial market that--\n                    (A) sells or slaughters terrestrial, including \n                avian, wildlife for human consumption as food or \n                medicine, whether the animals originated in the wild or \n                in a captive environment; and\n                    (B) delivers a product in communities where \n                alternative nutritional or protein sources are \n                available; and\n            (2) does not include markets in areas where no other \n        practical alternative sources of protein or meat exists, such \n        as wildlife markets in rural areas on which indigenous people \n        rely to feed themselves and their families.\n\nSEC. 3. STUDY ON RISK OF WILDLIFE MARKETS ON THE EMERGENCE OF NOVEL \n              VIRAL PATHOGENS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \nseek to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of \nSciences, Engineering, and Medicine under which the National Academies \nof Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine agrees to conduct a study to \nevaluate--\n            (1) the impact of physical proximity and consumption of \n        terrestrial wildlife as food or medicine on the emergence of \n        viral and other microbial pathogens;\n            (2) the impact of consumption of terrestrial wildlife as \n        food or medicine on the transmission of novel viral and other \n        microbial pathogens;\n            (3) the role consumption of terrestrial wildlife as food or \n        medicine has on the transmission of microbes from animals to \n        humans; and\n            (4) the conditions at live wildlife markets that lead to \n        transmission of zoonotic diseases.\n    (b) Report.--The agreement under subsection (a) shall require the \nNational Academies to, not later than one year after the date of such \nagreement, submit a report to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce of the House of Representatives on the findings of the study \nconducted pursuant to subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that global \ninstitutions, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), \nand the World Health Organization (WHO), together with leading \nnongovernmental organizations, veterinary colleges, and the United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID), should promote the \nparadigm of One Health--the integration of human health, animal health, \nagriculture, ecosystems, and the environment as an effective and \nintegrated way to address the complexity of emerging disease threats.\n    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \nfacilitate international cooperation by working with international \npartners and through intergovernmental, international, and \nnongovernmental organizations such as the United Nations to--\n            (1) lead a resolution at the United Nations Security \n        Council or General Assembly and World Health Assembly outlining \n        the danger to human and animal health from emerging zoonotic \n        infectious diseases, with recommendations for implementing the \n        worldwide closure of wildlife markets and the ending of the \n        associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed \n        and supply those markets, except for in such countries or \n        regions where the consumption of wildlife is necessary for \n        local food security or where such actions would significantly \n        disrupt a readily available and irreplaceable food supply;\n            (2) work with governments through existing treaties and the \n        United Nations to develop a new protocol or agreement, and \n        amend existing protocols or agreements, regarding stopping \n        deforestation and other ecosystem destruction, closing \n        commercial wildlife markets for human consumption, and end the \n        associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that feed \n        and supply those markets while ensuring full consideration to \n        the needs and rights of indigenous peoples and local \n        communities that are dependent on wildlife for their food \n        security, national sovereignty, and local laws and customs;\n            (3) disrupt and ultimately end the commercial international \n        trade in terrestrial wildlife associated with wildlife markets \n        and eliminate commercial wildlife markets;\n            (4) disrupt and ultimately eliminate wildlife trafficking \n        associated with the operation of wildlife markets;\n            (5) raise awareness on the dangerous potential of wildlife \n        markets as a source of zoonotic diseases such as the novel \n        coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 and reduce demand \n        for the consumption of wildlife through evidence-based behavior \n        change programs while ensuring that existing wildlife habitat \n        is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of this process;\n            (6) encourage and support alternate forms of food \n        production, farming, and shifts to domestic animal- or plant-\n        source foods instead of terrestrial wildlife where able and \n        appropriate, and reduce consumer demand for terrestrial \n        wildlife through enhanced local and national food systems, \n        especially in areas where wildlife markets play a significant \n        role in meeting subsistence needs while ensuring that existing \n        wildlife habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of \n        this process; and\n            (7) strive to increase hygienic standards implemented in \n        markets around the globe, especially those specializing in the \n        sale of products intended for human consumption.\n    (c) Activities.--\n            (1) Global prohibitions and enforcement.--The United States \n        Government, working through the United Nations and its \n        components, as well as international organization such as \n        Interpol and the World Organisation for Animal Health, and in \n        furtherance of the policies described in subsection (b), \n        shall--\n                    (A) collaboratively with other member states, issue \n                declarations, statements, and communiques urging a \n                global ban on commercial wildlife markets and trade for \n                human consumption; and\n                    (B) urge increased enforcement of existing laws to \n                end wildlife trafficking.\n            (2) International coalitions.--The Secretary of State shall \n        seek to build international coalitions focused on ending \n        commercial wildlife markets for human consumption and \n        associated wildlife trade which feeds and supplies said \n        markets, with a focus on the following efforts:\n                    (A) Providing assistance and advice to other \n                governments in the adoption of legislation and \n                regulations to close wildlife markets and trade for \n                human consumption.\n                    (B) Creating economic pressure on wildlife markets \n                and their supply chains to prevent their operation.\n                    (C) Providing assistance and guidance to other \n                governments to prohibit the import, export, and \n                domestic trade of live terrestrial wildlife for the \n                purpose of human consumption.\n                    (D) Engaging and receiving guidance from key \n                stakeholders at the ministerial, local government, and \n                civil society level in countries that will be impacted \n                by this Act and where wildlife markets and associated \n                wildlife trafficking is the predominant source of meat \n                or protein, in order to mitigate the impact of any \n                international efforts on local customs, conservation \n                methods, or cultural norms.\n            (3) Authorization of imposition of sanctions.--\n                    (A) Finding and report required.--\n                            (i) In general.--The Secretary of

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Equitable Data Collection and \nDisclosure on COVID-19 Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a \n        ``Public Health Emergency of International Concern'' on January \n        30, 2020. By late March 2020, there have been over 470,000 \n        confirmed cases of, and 20,000 deaths associated with, COVID-19 \n        worldwide.\n            (2) In the United States, cases of COVID-19 have quickly \n        surpassed those across the world, and as of April 12, 2020, \n        over 500,000 cases and 20,000 deaths have been reported in the \n        United States alone.\n            (3) Early reporting on racial inequities in COVID-19 \n        testing and treatment have renewed calls for the Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention and other relevant subagencies \n        within the Department of Health and Human Services to publicly \n        release racial and demographic information to better inform the \n        pandemic response, specifically in communities of color and in \n        Limited English Proficient (LEP) communities.\n            (4) The burden of morbidity and mortality in the United \n        States has historically fallen disproportionately on \n        marginalized communities (those who suffer the most from great \n        public health needs and are the most medically underserved).\n            (5) Historically, structures and systems, such as racism, \n        ableism and class oppression, have rendered affected \n        individuals more vulnerable to inequities and have prevented \n        people from achieving their optimal health even when there is \n        not a crisis of pandemic proportions.\n            (6) Significant differences in access to health care, \n        specifically to primary health care providers, health care \n        information, and greater perceived discrimination in health \n        care place communities of color, individuals with disabilities, \n        and LEP individuals at greater risk of receiving delayed, and \n        perhaps poorer, health care.\n            (7) Stark racial inequities across the United States, \n        including unequal access to stable housing, quality education, \n        and decent employment significantly impact the ability of \n        individuals to take care of their most basic health needs. \n        Communities of color are more likely to experience homelessness \n        and struggle with low-paying jobs or unemployment. To date, \n        experts have cited that 2 in 5 Latino residents in New York \n        City, the current epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, are \n        recently unemployed as a direct consequence of COVID-19. And at \n        a time when sheltering in place will save lives, less than 1 in \n        5 Black workers and roughly 1 in 6 Latino workers are able to \n        work from home.\n            (8) Communities of color experience higher rates of chronic \n        disease and disabilities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and \n        asthma, than non-Hispanic White communities, which predisposes \n        them to greater risk of complications and mortality should they \n        contract COVID-19.\n            (9) Such communities are made even more vulnerable to the \n        uncertainty of the preparation, response, and events \n        surrounding the pandemic public health crisis, COVID-19. For \n        instance, in the recent past, multiple epidemiologic studies \n        and reviews have reported higher rates of hospitalization due \n        to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic among the poor, individuals with \n        disabilities and preexisting conditions, those living in \n        impoverished neighborhoods, and individuals of color and ethnic \n        backgrounds in the United States. These findings highlight the \n        urgency to adapt the COVID-19 response to monitor and act on \n        these inequities via data collection and research by race and \n        ethnicity.\n            (10) Research experts recognize that there are underlying \n        differences in illness and death when each of these factors are \n        examined through socioeconomic and racial or ethnic lenses. \n        These socially determinant factors of health accelerate disease \n        and degradation.\n            (11) Language barriers are highly correlated with \n        medication noncompliance and inconsistent engagement with \n        health systems. Without language accessibility data and \n        research around COVID-19, these communities are less likely to \n        receive critical testing and preventive health services. Yet, \n        to date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not \n        disseminate COVID-19 messaging in critical languages, including \n        Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, and Korean within the same timeframe \n        as information in English despite requirements to ensure \n        limited English proficient populations are not discriminated \n        against under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \n        subsequent laws and Federal policies.\n            (12) Further, it is critical to disaggregate data further \n        by ancestry to address disparities among Asian American, Native \n        Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander groups. According to the \n        National Equity Atlas, while 13 percent of the Asian population \n        overall lived in poverty in 2015, 39 percent of Burmese people, \n        29 percent of Hmong people, and 21 percent of Pacific Islanders \n        lived in poverty.\n            (13) Utilizing disaggregation of enrollment in Affordable \n        Care Act-sponsored health insurance, the Asian and Pacific \n        Islander American Health Forum found that prior to the passage \n        of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law \n        111-148), Korean Americans had a high uninsured rate of 23 \n        percent, compared to just 12 percent for all Asian Americans. \n        Developing targeted outreach efforts assisted 1,000,000 people \n        and resulted in a 56-percent decrease in the uninsured among \n        the Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander population. \n        Such efforts show that disaggregated data is essential to \n        public health mobilizations efforts.\n            (14) Without clear understanding of how COVID-19 impacts \n        marginalized racial and ethnic communities, there will be \n        exacerbated risk of endangering the most historically \n        vulnerable of our Nation.\n            (15) The consequences of misunderstanding the racial and \n        ethnic impact of COVID-19 expound beyond communities of color \n        such that it would impact all.\n            (16) Race and ethnicity are valuable research and practice \n        variables when used and interpreted appropriately. Health data \n        collected on patients by race and ethnicity will boost and more \n        efficiently direct critical resources and inform risk \n        communication development in languages and at appropriate \n        health literacy levels, which resonate with historically \n        vulnerable communities of color.\n            (17) To date, there is no public standardized and \n        comprehensive race and ethnicity data repository of COVID-19 \n        testing, hospitalizations, or mortality. The inconsistency of \n        data collection by Federal, State, and local health \n        authorities, and the inability to access data by public \n        research institutions and academic organizations, poses a \n        threat to analysis and synthesis of the pandemic impact on \n        communities of color. However, research and medical experts of \n        Historically Black Colleges and Universities, academic health \n        care institutions which are historically and geographically \n        embedded in minoritized and marginalized communities, generally \n        also possess rapport with the communities they serve. They are \n        well-positioned, as trusted thought leaders and health care \n        service providers, to collect data and conduct research toward \n        creating holistic solutions to remedy the inequitable impact of \n        this and future public health crises.\n            (18) Well-designed, ethically sound research aligns with \n        the goals of medicine, addresses questions relevant to the \n        population among whom the study will be carried out, balances \n        the potential for benefit against the potential for harm, \n        employs study designs that will yield scientifically valid and \n        significant data, and generates useful knowledge.\n            (19) The dearth of racially and ethnically disaggregated \n        data reflecting the health of communities of color underlies \n        the challenges of a fully informed public health response.\n            (20) Without collecting race and ethnicity data associated \n        with COVID-19 testing, hospitalizations, morbidities, and \n        mortalities, as well as publicly disclosing it, communities of \n        color will remain at greater risk of disease and death.\n\nSEC. 3. EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR FEDERAL DATA COLLECTION ON THE RACIAL, \n              ETHNIC, AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES OF COVID-19.\n\n    To conduct or support data collection on the racial, ethnic, and \nother demographic implications of COVID-19 in the United States and its \nterritories, including support to assist in the capacity building for \nState and local public health departments to collect and transmit \nracial, ethnic, and other demographic data to the relevant Department \nof Health and Human Services agencies, there is authorized to be \nappropriated--\n            (1) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n        $12,000,000;\n            (2) to State, territorial, and Tribal public health \n        agencies, distributed proportionally based on the total \n        population of their residents who are enrolled in Medicaid or \n        who have no health insurance, $15,000,000;\n            (3) to the Indian Health Service, Indian Tribes and Tribal \n        organizations (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-\n        Determination and Education Assistance Act), and urban Indian \n        organizations (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Health \n        Care Improvement Act), $3,000,000;\n            (4) to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, \n        $5,000,000;\n            (5) to the Food and Drug Administration, $5,000,000;\n            (6) to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, \n        $5,000,000; and\n            (7) to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health \n        Information Technology, $5,000,000.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Equitable Data Collection and \nDisclosure on COVID-19 Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a \n        ``Public Health Emergency of International Concern'' on January \n        30, 2020. By late March 2020, there have been over 470,000 \n        confirmed cases of, and 20,000 deaths associated with, COVID-19 \n        worldwide.\n            (2) In the United States, cases of COVID-19 have quickly \n        surpassed those across the world, and as of April 12, 2020, \n        over 500,000 cases and 20,000 deaths have been reported in the \n        United States alone.\n            (3) Early reporting on racial inequities in COVID-19 \n        testing and treatment has renewed calls for the Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention and other relevant subagencies \n        within the Department of Health and Human Services to publicly \n        release racial and demographic information to better inform the \n        pandemic response, specifically in communities of color and in \n        Limited English Proficient (LEP) communities.\n            (4) The burden of morbidity and mortality in the United \n        States has historically fallen disproportionately on \n        marginalized communities (those who suffer the most from great \n        public health needs and are the most medically underserved).\n            (5) Historically, structures and systems such as racism, \n        ableism and class oppression, have rendered affected \n        individuals more vulnerable to inequities and have prevented \n        people from achieving optimal health even when there is not a \n        crisis of pandemic proportions.\n            (6) Significant differences in access to health care, \n        specifically to primary health care providers, health care \n        information, and greater perceived discrimination in health \n        care place communities of color, individuals with disabilities, \n        and LEP individuals at greater risk of receiving delayed, and \n        perhaps poorer, health care.\n            (7) Stark racial inequities across the United States, \n        including unequal access to stable housing, quality education, \n        and decent employment, significantly impact the ability of \n        individuals to take care of their most basic health needs. \n        Communities of color are more likely to experience homelessness \n        and struggle with low-paying jobs or unemployment. To date, \n        experts have cited that 2 in 5 Latino residents in New York \n        City, the current epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, are \n        recently unemployed as a direct consequence of COVID-19. And at \n        a time when sheltering in place will save lives, less than 1 in \n        5 Black workers and roughly 1 in 6 Latino workers are able to \n        work from home.\n            (8) Communities of color experience higher rates of chronic \n        disease and disabilities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and \n        asthma, than non-Hispanic White communities, which predisposes \n        them to greater risk of complications and mortality should they \n        contract COVID-19.\n            (9) Such communities are made even more vulnerable to the \n        uncertainty of the preparation, response, and events \n        surrounding the pandemic public health crisis, COVID-19. For \n        instance, in the recent past, multiple epidemiologic studies \n        and reviews have reported higher rates of hospitalization due \n        to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic among the poor, individuals with \n        disabilities and preexisting conditions, those living in \n        impoverished neighborhoods, and individuals of color and \n        marginalized ethnic backgrounds in the United States. These \n        findings highlight the urgency to adapt the COVID-19 response \n        to monitor and act on these inequities via data collection and \n        research by race and ethnicity.\n            (10) Research experts recognize that there are underlying \n        differences in illness and death when each of these factors is \n        examined through socioeconomic and racial or ethnic lenses. \n        These socially determinant factors of health accelerate disease \n        and degradation.\n            (11) Language barriers are highly correlated with \n        medication noncompliance and inconsistent engagement with \n        health systems. Without language accessibility data and \n        research around COVID-19, these communities are less likely to \n        receive critical testing and preventive health services. Yet, \n        to date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does \n        not disseminate COVID-19 messaging in critical languages, \n        including Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, and Korean within the same \n        timeframe as information in English despite requirements to \n        ensure limited English proficient populations are not \n        discriminated against under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of \n        1964 and subsequent laws and Federal policies.\n            (12) Further, it is critical to disaggregate data further \n        by ancestry to address disparities among Asian American, Native \n        Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander groups. According to the \n        National Equity Atlas, while 13 percent of the Asian population \n        overall lived in poverty in 2015, 39 percent of Burmese people, \n        29 percent of Hmong people, and 21 percent of Pacific Islanders \n        lived in poverty.\n            (13) Utilizing disaggregation of enrollment in Affordable \n        Care Act-sponsored health insurance, the Asian and Pacific \n        Islander American Health Forum found that prior to the passage \n        of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law \n        111-148), Korean Americans had a high uninsured rate of 23 \n        percent, compared to just 12 percent for all Asian Americans. \n        Developing targeted outreach efforts assisted 1,000,000 people \n        and resulted in a 56-percent decrease in the uninsured among \n        the Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander population. \n        Such efforts show that disaggregated data is essential to \n        public health mobilizations efforts.\n            (14) Without clear understanding of how COVID-19 impacts \n        marginalized racial and ethnic communities, there will be \n        exacerbated risk of endangering the most historically \n        vulnerable of our Nation.\n            (15) The consequences of misunderstanding the racial and \n        ethnic impact of COVID-19 expound beyond communities of color \n        such that it would impact all.\n            (16) Race and ethnicity are valuable research and practice \n        variables when used and interpreted appropriately. Health data \n        collected on patients by race and ethnicity will boost and more \n        efficiently direct critical resources and inform risk \n        communication development in languages and at appropriate \n        health literacy levels, which resonate with historically \n        vulnerable communities of color.\n            (17) To date, there is no public standardized and \n        comprehensive race and ethnicity data repository of COVID-19 \n        testing, hospitalizations, or mortality. The inconsistency of \n        data collection by Federal, State, and local health \n        authorities, and the inability to access data by public \n        research institutions and academic organizations, poses a \n        threat to analysis and synthesis of the pandemic impact on \n        communities of color. However, research and medical experts of \n        Historically Black Colleges and Universities, academic health \n        care institutions which are historically and geographically \n        embedded in minoritized and marginalized communities, generally \n        also possess rapport with the communities they serve. They are \n        well-positioned, as trusted thought leaders and health care \n        service providers, to collect data and conduct research toward \n        creating holistic solutions to remedy the inequitable impact of \n        this and future public health crises.\n            (18) Well-designed, ethically sound research aligns with \n        the goals of medicine, addresses questions relevant to the \n        population among whom the study will be carried out, balances \n        the potential for benefit against the potential for harm, \n        employs study designs that will yield scientifically valid and \n        significant data, and generates useful knowledge.\n            (19) The dearth of racially and ethnically disaggregated \n        data reflecting the health of communities of color underlies \n        the challenges of a fully informed public health response.\n            (20) Without collecting race and ethnicity data associated \n        with COVID-19 testing, hospitalizations, morbidities, and \n        mortalities, as well as publicly disclosing it, communities of \n        color will remain at greater risk of disease and death.\n\nSEC. 3. EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR FEDERAL DATA COLLECTION ON THE RACIAL, \n              ETHNIC, AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES OF COVID-19.\n\n    To conduct or support data collection on the racial, ethnic, and \nother demographic implications of COVID-19 in the United States and its \nterritories, including support to assist in the capacity building for \nState and local public health departments to collect and transmit \nracial, ethnic, and other demographic data to the relevant Department \nof Health and Human Services agencies, there is authorized to be \nappropriated--\n            (1) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n        $12,000,000;\n            (2) to State and territorial public health agencies, \n        distributed proportionally based on the total population of \n        their residents who are enrolled in Medicaid or who have no \n        health insurance, $15,000,000;\n            (3) to the Indian Health Service, Indian Tribes and Tribal \n        organizations (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-\n        Determination and Education Assistance Act), and urban Indian \n        organizations (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Health \n        Care Improvement Act), $3,000,000;\n            (4) to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, \n        $5,000,000;\n            (5) to the Food and Drug Administration, $5,000,000;\n            (6) to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, \n        $5,000,000; and\n            (7) to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health \n        Information Technology, $5,000,000.\n\nSEC. 4.

SUPPORT FOR EFFORTS OF THE GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT AIDS, \n              TUBERCULOSIS AND MALARIA TO RESPOND TO COVID-19.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the COVID-19 pandemic threatens gains made through \n        decades of investments to combat the spread of AIDS, \n        tuberculosis, and malaria;\n            (2) COVID-19 poses a threat to the health systems of \n        resource-constrained countries, including strains on laboratory \n        capacity and supply chains for health commodities, as well as \n        availability of healthcare workers and equipment and supplies;\n            (3) interruptions in treatment for AIDS, tuberculosis, and \n        malaria due to disruptions in supply chains for critical drugs \n        and medical equipment and supplies, as well as the diversion of \n        healthcare workers, could significantly increase the death toll \n        from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, potentially exceeding the \n        number of deaths from COVID-19 itself; and\n            (4) the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \n        has a strong track record of working with partners in resource-\n        constrained settings to ensure delivery of services and \n        commodities.\n    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Notwithstanding section \n202(d)(4)(A)(i) of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7622(d)(4)(A)(i)), \nthere is authorized to be appropriated $1,000,000,000 for an immediate \ncontribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \nMalaria, specifically for its COVID-19 response mechanism, to be \navailable until expended.\n\n          Subtitle B--International Economic Pandemic Response\n\nSEC. 211. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BUILDING RESILIENCE.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that United States foreign assistance \nand finance must improve the ability of people, households, \ncommunities, countries, regions, institutions, and systems to assess, \nanticipate, prevent, adapt to, cope with, and recover from shocks and \nstresses, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in ways that--\n            (1) account for, and reduce chronic vulnerability resulting \n        from, disruptive or potentially disruptive changes in national \n        and community demographics, the environment and natural \n        resource availability, public health threats like the COVID-19 \n        outbreak, political leadership, and economic growth trends;\n            (2) address structural drivers of shocks, stresses, and \n        vulnerability, including poor governance, weak public \n        institutions, and systemic gender, religious, or ethnic-based \n        marginalization and economic exclusion;\n            (3) expand resilience capacities, inclusive economic growth \n        opportunities, and equitable access to capital and market tools \n        across diverse populations and communities in developing \n        countries;\n            (4) strengthen inclusive governance and economic growth, \n        peace and stability, and food and nutrition security in the \n        face of current and potential disruptions, and the capacities \n        of national and local institutions charged with serving the \n        public good and ensuring public safety;\n            (5) advance a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach \n        to build capacities that protect, improve, and sustain growth, \n        peace, and stability and preparedness against shocks in \n        developing countries and for populations most vulnerable to \n        persistent and forecasted shocks and stresses;\n            (6) improve international support of the United States \n        Government for sustained inclusive long-term growth, peace and \n        stability, equality, and good governance in developing \n        countries, at the national and subnational levels, through the \n        collection, evaluation, and practical application of \n        information on persistent and forecasted shocks and stresses, \n        such as epidemics, pandemics, and climate change;\n            (7) assess and measure the progress of United States \n        foreign assistance in helping households, communities, systems, \n        and institutions measure impact on improving development, \n        peace, and stability outcomes following shocks and stresses or \n        to prevent shocks from materializing; and\n            (8) foster partnerships and seek commitments from host \n        countries to--\n                    (A) make inclusive investments;\n                    (B) implement reforms;\n                    (C) execute programs that build resilience \n                capacities and planning towards the achievement of \n                long-term sustainable development and growth;\n                    (D) establish safeguards against shocks like \n                epidemics, pandemics, and climate change; and\n                    (E) ensure responsible agents are accountable.\n\nSEC. 212. FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS AND GLOBAL HEALTH \n              SECURITY.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) no country is fully prepared to respond to epidemic or \n        pandemic threats, and as COVID-19 has demonstrated, an outbreak \n        anywhere can quickly escalate to become a threat everywhere;\n            (2) the work of international public institutions and \n        publicly and privately funded organizations and initiatives \n        such as the World Health Organization, the Global Preparedness \n        Monitoring Board, the GHSA, and others to identify and develop \n        action plans, set standards, develop tools for evaluation, and \n        undertake assessments has been critical to efforts to improve \n        global health security;\n            (3) lack of resources and incentives have proven to be \n        obstacles to lower-income countries, which have not allocated \n        sufficient funding from national budgets to fill their pandemic \n        preparedness gaps identified through Joint External \n        Evaluations;\n            (4) recent estimates suggest that the costs for most lower-\n        income countries to close their gaps in preparedness would be \n        less than $2 per person per year, which is significantly lower \n        than the trillions of dollars in costs to United States \n        taxpayers resulting from the health and economic impact of \n        pandemics; and\n            (5) the World Bank has a critical role in helping lower-\n        income countries finance actions to fill gaps identified \n        through existing assessments and national action plans to \n        prevent, detect, and respond to epidemic and pandemic threats.\n    (b) Establishment of a World Bank Trust Fund.--\n            (1) In general.--The United States Executive Director to \n        the World Bank Group shall use the voice and vote of the United \n        States to advocate for the establishment of a multi-donor trust \n        fund to incentivize and support countries to develop and \n        implement credible national action plans aimed at preventing, \n        detecting, and responding to epidemics and pandemics, including \n        to further incentivize countries with such plans to provide \n        domestic resources towards their implementation (in this \n        section referred to as the ``Trust Fund''). The United States \n        Executive Director shall ensure that the Trust Fund--\n                    (A) is available to low-income countries that have \n                developed a credible national action plan on health \n                security, including those that have prioritized \n                pandemic preparedness funding in their national \n                budgets;\n                    (B) places specific emphasis on use of the funds \n                for--\n                            (i) acquisition of technical assistance for \n                        the development and implementation of national \n                        action plans for health security that seek to \n                        achieve specific, measurable targets, including \n                        targets identified through Joint External \n                        Evaluations carried out in keeping with the \n                        International Health Regulations (2005);\n                            (ii) financing for the implementation of \n                        actions and activities meant to fill gaps \n                        identified through rigorously developed and \n                        evaluated national action plans for health \n                        security that identify measurable steps to \n                        build and sustain capacity to prevent, detect, \n                        and respond to epidemic threats, including \n                        those that have undergone Joint External \n                        Evaluations and in keeping with the targets of \n                        the Global Health Security Agenda;\n                            (iii) financing through mechanisms aimed at \n                        creating incentives for countries to devote an \n                        increasing share of their own resources to core \n                        preparedness functions and to make measurable, \n                        independently verified progress against \n                        preparedness outcomes such as national action \n                        plan benchmarks, Joint External Evaluation and \n                        Global Health Security Index scores, or other \n                        credible, rigorously developed, measurable \n                        plans;\n                            (iv) leverage over public and private \n                        sector funding, including country resources and \n                        resources from government donors, development \n                        banks, private sector entities, philanthropies, \n                        and other non-governmental entities, to \n                        incentivize countries to prioritize health \n                        security;\n                            (v) resources for the purposes of measuring \n                        progress made towards achieving benchmarks and \n                        milestones in closing gaps, and for \n                        evaluations;\n                            (vi) activities to conduct regular \n                        exercises of health security capacities and for \n                        publishing and disseminating annual after-\n                        action reviews based on simulation exercises;

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL \n              DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress as follows:\n            (1) The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a global economic \n        recession as evidenced by, but not limited to, the following \n        global economic indicators:\n                    (A) The United Nations Conference on Trade and \n                Development estimates that the economic uncertainty \n                associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will likely cost \n                the global economy at least $1,000,000,000,000 in 2020.\n                    (B) Global markets have suffered losses ranging \n                between 5 percent and over 10 percent since the \n                beginning of the pandemic.\n                    (C) African finance ministers recently announced \n                that the continent will need at least a \n                $100,000,000,000 stimulus package, including the \n                suspension of debt service payments.\n            (2) Even when markets begin to recover in the future, \n        access to capital will likely be especially challenging for \n        developing countries, which likely also will be struggling with \n        the containment of and recovery from COVID-19.\n            (3) Economic uncertainty and inability of individuals and \n        households to generate income is a major driver of political \n        instability and social discord, which creates conditions for \n        insecurity.\n            (4) It is in the security and economic interests of the \n        United States to assist in the economic recovery of developing \n        countries that are made more vulnerable and unstable from both \n        the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 \n        pandemic.\n            (5) United States foreign assistance and development \n        finance institutions must blunt the impacts of a COVID-19 \n        related economic recession by supporting investments in sectors \n        critical to maintaining economic stability and resilience in \n        low and middle income countries.\n            (6) The need for the United States International \n        Development Finance Corporation's support for advancing \n        development outcomes in less developed countries, as mandated \n        by the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development \n        Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), is critical to ensuring \n        lasting and resilient economic growth in light of the COVID-19 \n        pandemic's exacerbation of economic hardships and challenges.\n            (7) The United States International Development Finance \n        Corporation is encouraged to adjust its view of risk versus \n        return by taking smart risks that may produce a lower rate of \n        financial return but produce significant development outcomes \n        in responding to the economic effects of COVID-19.\n            (8) To mitigate the economic impacts of the COVID-19 \n        recession, the United States International Development Finance \n        Corporation should use its resources and authorities to, among \n        other things--\n                    (A) offer borrowers loans and loan guarantees at \n                concessional rates below the Federal Reserve interest \n                rate;\n                    (B) ensure loan support for small- and medium-sized \n                enterprises;\n                    (C) offer local currency loans to borrowers for \n                working capital needs;\n                    (D) create dedicated financing opportunities for \n                new ``customers'' that are experiencing financial \n                hardship due to COVID-19;\n                    (E) extend grace periods for loan payment and \n                repayment to borrowers experiencing hardship due to the \n                COVID-19 pandemic; and\n                    (F) work with other development finance \n                institutions to create co-financing facilities to \n                support customers experiencing hardship due to the \n                COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSEC. 214.

and\n            (2) extraordinary policy measures, such as border closures \n        and travel restrictions, which impose unusual burdens for those \n        seeking international protection, should be lifted as soon as \n        circumstances permit, and exceptions to such measures should be \n        made for highly vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers.\n    (b) Resumption of Refugee Resettlement.--The Secretary of State, in \ncoordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall--\n            (1) extend the period of validity for refugee visas;\n            (2) continue processing immigration benefits, including \n        security vetting, to the extent such processing is unaffected \n        by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n            (3) expeditiously resume refugee resettlement through the \n        United States Refugee Admissions Program upon the resumption of \n        international refugee resettlement operations by the United \n        Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International \n        Organization for Migration;\n            (4) reallocate refugee admissions to ensure that--\n                    (A) the number of refugees authorized to be \n                admitted for fiscal year 2020 under section 207(a) of \n                the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1157(a)) \n                will be reached;

SAFEGUARDING DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS DURING THE COVID-19 \n              PANDEMIC.\n\n    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) governments may be required to take appropriate but \n        extraordinary actions, during public health emergencies, to \n        halt the spread of disease, including closing businesses and \n        public events, limiting access to public spaces, and \n        restricting the movement of people;\n            (2) authorities in more than 82 countries, including the \n        United States, have declared states of emergency due to the \n        threat of COVID-19, which the World Health Organization \n        designated a global pandemic on March 11, 2020;\n            (3) governments in certain countries with COVID-19 cases, \n        such as Cambodia, Egypt, Hungary, India, Turkey, China, and the \n        China Liaison Office in Hong Kong, have taken measures that \n        violate the human rights of their citizens without clear public \n        health justification, oversight measures, or sunset provisions;\n            (4) governments in 25 countries, including Kenya, Iran, the \n        Philippines, Thailand, and Jordan, have taken measures that \n        affect expression and restrict freedom of the press;\n            (5) against a backdrop of rising nationalism, populism, \n        authoritarianism and pushback against human rights in some \n        countries, the crisis can provide a pretext unrelated to the \n        pandemic for governments to engage in repression, including \n        measures that undermine democratic institutions, quash \n        legitimate dissent, and attack journalists, activists, and \n        disfavored social groups, like refugees and migrants, with far-\n        reaching consequences that outlive the current crisis;\n            (6) the United States Government, implementing emergency \n        policies at home and through its diplomacy and foreign \n        assistance abroad, should assertively champion the protection \n        of internationally recognized human rights during and after the \n        COVID-19 pandemic; and\n            (7) during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department \n        of State and the United States Agency for International \n        Development should directly or through nongovernmental \n        organizations or international organizations, provide \n        assistance and implement programs that support democratic \n        institutions, civil society, free media, and internationally \n        recognized human rights.\n    (b) Funding for Civil Society and Human Rights Defenders.--\n            (1) Program priorities.--Amounts made available for fiscal \n        years 2021 through 2025 to carry out programs authorized under \n        sections 101 and 102 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n        U.S.C. 2151 and 2151-1), including programs to support \n        democratic institutions, human rights defenders, civil society, \n        and freedom of the press, shall be particularly targeted, to \n        the extent feasible, at countries in which emergency government \n        measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic violated \n        internationally recognized human rights.\n            (2) Eligible countries.--Countries in which emergency \n        government measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic \n        violated internationally recognized human rights, and civil \n        society organizations serving those countries, shall be \n        eligible to receive funds made available pursuant to sections \n        101 and 102 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for each of \n        fiscal years 2021 through 2025, for--\n                    (A) programs designed to strengthen and support \n                civil society, human rights defenders, and the freedom \n                of the press;

PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 AT THE UNITED STATES-MEXICO \n              BORDER.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) In January 2019, the Department of Homeland Security \n        began implementing the Migrant Protection Protocols, which \n        require foreign nationals entering or seeking admission to the \n        United States from Mexico, without proper documentation, to be \n        returned to Mexico for the duration of their immigration \n        proceedings.\n            (2) Approximately 60,000 foreign nationals who have been \n        subjected to the Migrant Protection Protocols are temporarily \n        residing in Mexican communities close to the border between the \n        United States and Mexico, and some of them are living in \n        encampments that lack basic health and sanitation \n        infrastructure.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) asylum seekers living in Mexican communities close to \n        the United States-Mexico border as a result of the Migrant \n        Protection Protocols are highly vulnerable to the transmission \n        of COVID-19; and\n            (2) the spread of COVID-19 in these communities would have \n        a direct impact on United States communities on the other side \n        of the border, the residents of such communities, and their \n        public health systems.\n    (c) Termination of Authorization of Migrant Protection Protocols.--\nSection 235(b)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n1225(b)(2)) is amended--\n            (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``subparagraphs (B) \n        and (C)'' and inserting ``subparagraph (B)''; and\n            (2) by striking subparagraph (C).\n\nSEC. 243. LIMITATIONS ON REMOVAL OF FOREIGN NATIONALS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Secretary of Homeland Security has deported from \n        the United States--\n                    (A) Guatemalan nationals, who have been sent back \n                to Guatemala;\n                    (B) Mexican nationals, who have been sent back to \n                Mexico; and\n                    (C) Haitian nationals, who have been sent back to \n                Haiti.\n            (2) Some of the people referred to in paragraph (1) have \n        tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in their country of \n        origin.\n            (3) In 2019, the Secretary of Homeland Security signed \n        Asylum Cooperative Agreements with the Governments of \n        Guatemala, of Honduras, and of El Salvador to transfer asylum \n        seekers from the United States.\n            (4) The public health systems of Guatemala, Haiti, \n        Honduras, El Salvador, and other countries have limited \n        capacity for handling severe or critical cases of COVID-19, as \n        documented by United States Embassies in each country.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) deporting foreign nationals suffering from COVID-19 to \n        countries that lack sufficient public health capacity to \n        address the pandemic increases the risk for uncontrolled \n        outbreaks of COVID-19 in foreign countries;\n            (2) uncontrolled outbreaks of COVID-19 in foreign countries \n        increase the risk that COVID-19 will be reintroduced into the \n        United States in the future;\n            (3) the Secretary of Homeland Security must test all \n        foreign nationals for COVID-19 before deporting them to their \n        respective countries of origin; and\n            (4) the transfer of asylum seekers from the United States \n        to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador poses unnecessary risks \n        to the health and safety of the individuals being transferred \n        and communities in recipient countries while the COVID-19 \n        pandemic remains uncontrolled.\n    (c) Limitation on Removals.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \nlaw, the Secretary of Homeland Security is prohibited from removing \nforeign nationals from the United States to their respective countries \nof origin until after the Secretary of Homeland Security and the \nSecretary of State jointly certify to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on the Judiciary of the \nHouse of Representatives that--\n            (1) the Secretary of Homeland Security has developed and \n        implemented a protocol to ensure that all foreign nationals \n        with an order of removal from the United States will be tested \n        for COVID-19 before being removed from the United States; and\n            (2) the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of \n        State have provided appropriate foreign governments with \n        information about the COVID-19 testing protocol developed by \n        the Secretary of Homeland Security for foreign nationals who \n        are removed from the United States.\n\nSEC. 244.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 Misinformation and \nDisinformation Task Force Act of 2020''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) People in the United States rely on information from \n        mass media, social media, and digital media to make decisions \n        about all aspects of social and economic life.\n            (2) Ensuring that people in the United States are provided \n        accurate information to make informed decisions during a public \n        health crisis is of the utmost importance.\n            (3) In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, people in the \n        United States are spending more time online than ever before \n        and this increase has been coupled with a rise of \n        misinformation that impacts the daily lives of people in the \n        United States, including misinformation about the virus, public \n        health, our democracy, and the government's response.\n            (4) Globally, the proliferation of inaccurate health \n        information surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has led the World \n        Health Organization to label this problem an ``infodemic''.\n            (5) In addition to health-related misinformation, \n        intelligence officials and diplomats of the United States have \n        warned that China and Russia are exploiting this global crisis \n        to wage disinformation campaigns that seek to sow doubts about \n        the United States response to the crisis, undermine faith and \n        trust in United States Government institutions, and deflect \n        attention from China and Russia's inability to adequately and \n        transparently respond to issues associated with the pandemic.\n            (6) In February 2020, Assistant Secretary of State Philip \n        Reeker warned, ``Russia's intent is to sow discord and \n        undermine U.S. institutions and alliances from within, \n        including through covert and coercive malign influence \n        campaigns. By spreading disinformation about the coronavirus, \n        Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten \n        public safety by distracting from the global health \n        response.''.\n            (7) One prominent incident occurred in March when text \n        messages sent to people in the United States and amplified on \n        social media posts falsely claimed the Federal Government would \n        lock down the entire country due to the pandemic. Intelligence \n        officials of the United States reportedly assessed that Chinese \n        operatives helped amplify the false messages. The prolific \n        nature of this disinformation campaign required the National \n        Security Council to issue a denial.\n            (8) In May 2020, the Global Engagement Center of the \n        Department of State assessed that China was coordinating with \n        Russia to manipulate social media platforms to spread \n        disinformation about the pandemic.\n            (9) In July 2020, a newly declassified United States \n        intelligence assessment concluded that Russian intelligence \n        agencies and actors are spreading disinformation related to the \n        pandemic and United States officials reported that from late \n        May to early July, approximately 150 articles on the pandemic \n        were published as a result of such efforts.\n            (10) Since the beginning of the pandemic, American social \n        media companies have banned hundreds of user accounts linked to \n        coordinated influence operations by Russia, China, and Iran, \n        which were engaged in ``coordinated political issues'' related \n        to the coronavirus.\n            (11) European Union officials have also warned about \n        disinformation from China and Russia aimed at dividing European \n        society, undermining the public perception about the European \n        Union's response to the pandemic, all while misleading and \n        bolstering the public perception regarding China and Russia's \n        response to the pandemic.\n            (12) The bipartisan report of the Cyberspace Solarium \n        Commission concluded that--\n                    (A) the United States Government should promote \n                digital literacy, civics education, and public \n                awareness to build societal resilience to foreign \n                malign cyber-enabled information operations; and\n                    (B) a sustainable solution to fighting \n                misinformation and disinformation will require \n                equipping people in the United States with the media \n                and digital literacy necessary to recognize \n                untrustworthy online content.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Reopening Businesses \nRecovering from COVID-19 Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) COVID-19 is a highly contagious infectious disease \n        caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 with more than 6,000,000 people \n        worldwide, and more than 1,900,000 people in the United States, \n        infected.\n            (2) To flatten the infection curve, the United States \n        encouraged individuals to practice social distancing and States \n        issued stay-at-home orders to enforce social distancing.\n            (3) The necessary measures taken to flatten the curve \n        resulted in the closure or severe reduction in operations of \n        numerous businesses, including restaurants, retailers, and \n        hospitality industry business.\n            (4) The closure and reduction in operations of these \n        business precipitated a significant reduction of economic \n        activity and strained the long term health of many businesses.\n            (5) The measures taken appear to have flattened the \n        infection curve and States have begun to reopen.\n            (6) Health experts agree that COVID-19 remains a highly \n        infectious disease.\n            (7) As businesses reopen and customers begin to patronize \n        them there presents a risk of transmission despite mitigation \n        efforts taken by businesses.\n            (8) Businesses already strained by prior mitigation efforts \n        cannot afford further economic strain resulting from civil tort \n        claims stemming from customers and patrons contracting COVID-\n        19.\n            (9) Therefore, it is necessary to provide businesses and \n        healthcare providers with an exemption from liability for \n        claims arising from or relating to individuals contracting \n        COVID-19.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for an \nexemption from liability arising from claims arising from an individual \ncontracting of COVID-19 as a result of patronage of a business or \nhealth care entity during such time as a national health emergency \nexists.\n\nSEC. 3.
