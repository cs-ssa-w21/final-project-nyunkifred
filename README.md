# MACS 30122 Final Project

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the U.S. Congress has introduced and
processed a series of bills responding to the pandemic. Our project aims to
explore the changing patterns of the keywords in the text of legislative bills
introduced in the Congress during 2020, and see if there exists any
correlations between these keyword patterns and the trend in COVID-19 cases in
the U.S. on a monthly basis.
