# MACS 30122 Final Project

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the U.S. Congress has introduced and
processed a series of bills responding to the pandemic. Our project aims to
explore the changing patterns of the keywords in the text of legislative bills
introduced in the Congress during 2020, and see if there exists any
correlations between these keyword patterns and the trend in COVID-19 cases and 
economic indicators in the U.S. on a quarterly basis.

PART1-Data_Scraping-Nikki_Ting: contains the code for scraping the U.S. Congress
webpage for bills related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the output

PART2-Text_Analysis_Keywords-Naiyu_Jiang: contains the code for

PART3-Correlation_Matrix_Heatmap-Zheng_He: contains the code for creating the final
dataframe which includes the keywords whose frequencies are within the top-20 of 
all quarterly keyword lists produced by Naiyu Jiang's code, the correlation matrix
based upon the final dataframe, and the heatmap of that correlation matrix.
